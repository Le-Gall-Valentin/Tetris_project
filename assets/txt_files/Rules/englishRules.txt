The rules of this game are quite simple.

First of all, choose your grid with its size.

Then, you will have the choice between 3 forms to place.
Choose one by entering either 1, 2 or 3.
Then rotate it as you wish.

To finish enter the coordinates x: a, b, c | y: A, B, C.
If you can't place it here you lose a life!
This can be due to several factors:
	The form is off the grid!
	There is already a form there!

When the form is placed:

If a line is filled, it is emptied and,
all the pieces above it move down one space !
If a column is filled, it is also emptied,
but this time no further changes are made.
Your points increase in proportion to the
number of squares in the row or column.

There are two ways to stop the game.

You can write "exit" each time you can write,
in which case you finish the round and save.

Otherwise, the game stops automatically when your lives
at the base of 3 are reduced to 0.
